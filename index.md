Welcome to this short data story 👋  
We analyzed public crime records from San Francisco to uncover where safety and danger live side by side in the city.

## 🔍 What We Analyzed

We looked at 10+ years of crime data, organized by district, time of day, and category.

## 📊 Crime by District

*(Here you’ll add a bar chart or table showing per capita crime rates — we can generate it in Python and save it as an image)*

## 🗺️ Mapping the Danger

*(Add a map screenshot, or embed an interactive map — like a Folium/Leaflet map)*

## 💡 Insights

- Some districts have high crime volume just because they’re big
- When you normalize by population, surprising patterns appear
- Time of day has a smaller effect than location

## 🧪 Methods

- Python, pandas, seaborn for analysis
- Jekyll + GitHub Pages for publishing
